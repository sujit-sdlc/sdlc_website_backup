			<p>What, exactly, is Mocopi?
</p>		
		<p>Mocopi is a device that tracks your activities. It has six small sensors that you wear on your body.</p><p>Â </p><p>A separate sensor is attached to each wrist and ankle.</p><p>Â </p><p>You can get extra straps for the head and the waist.</p><p>Â </p><p>Through Bluetooth, the sensors can be paired with an app for Android or iOS.</p><p>Â </p><p>These small sensors weigh less than a tenth of an ounce and are just over half an inch (32 mm) in diameter (8 g).</p><p>Â </p><p>Because of this, after you put them on, you won't feel like you're wearing anything at all.</p><p>Â </p>		
			<h3>Making use of Mocopi</h3>		
		<p>Mocopi is a system that has no cords in any way. The USB-C port on the case can be used to charge the sensors.</p><p>Â </p><p>If you charge the device for 90 minutes, you should be able to use it for up to 10 hours.</p><p>Â </p><p>After you take the sensors out of their protective cases, you will need to sync each one with the control software on your mobile device.</p><p>Â </p><p>After that, you put them on a flat surface to connect them to the app. Once the sensors are on your body, you have to go through a series of calibration steps before you can use them.</p><p>Â </p>		
			<h3>Using a Mocopi to record video</h3>		
		<p>After you set up your virtual self for the first time with the Mocopi app, it will follow your every move.</p><p>Â </p><p>You can then use your digital self to make video diaries in the program.</p><p>Â </p><p>You can also add more avatars and change the background. You can lip-sync your character to your own voice by using the microphone on your phone.</p><p>Â </p><p>MP4 files can be used to save videos.</p><p>Â </p>		
			<h3>Use Mocopi to try out motion capture and analysis.</h3>		
		<p>Mocopi might also keep track of how you move as motion data. You can either save this motion data on your computer or have it sent to it in real time.</p><p>Â </p><p>For 3D rendering, this information is kept in the BVH format, which is used by many different programs.</p><p>Â </p><p>The motion data can also be sent in real time to third-party programs or services.</p><p>Â </p><p>This means that VRChat and other metaverse apps can be used to change your avatar.</p><p>Â </p>		
			<h2>Kit for developing software</h2>		
		<p>In their announcement, Sony also said that an software development kit (SDK) will be available on December 15.</p><p>Â </p><p>With the SDK, information from a Mocopi motion capture system can be linked to metaverse services.</p><p>Â </p><p>It also works with Autodesk's animation program MotionBuilder and the Unity development environment.</p><p>Â </p>		
			<h3>Verdict</h3>		
		<p>Mocopi is a new product that is interesting and has a lot of unrealized potential.</p><p>Â </p><p>Now that its software development kit (SDK) is out, Mocopi could be used as a low-cost motion capture tool for visual effects.</p><p>Â </p><p>Because of this, a much wider range of independent and low-budget filmmakers would be able to use motion capture.</p><p>Â </p><p>If the product does well, Sony may think about making it available to people in other countries.</p><p>Â </p>		
			<h3>Value and availability</h3>		
		<p>Japan will be the only market for Mocopi for the time being.</p><p>Â </p><p>Beginning in the middle of December 2022, you will be able to make reservations, and by the end of January 2023, you will be able to buy it.</p><p>Â </p><p>At the current exchange rate, a Mocopi will cost about $365, which is the same as 49,500 yen.</p><p>Â </p>		
			<h2>Is Mocopi the next big thing when it comes to virtual reality?</h2>		
		<p>Even though Sony's Mocopi has amazing features, it is still too early to say whether or not it will be successful in getting people to join the Metaverse.</p><p>Â </p><p>The biggest problems are the lack of a mobile app that can be used by a wide range of people and the limited suitability of smartphones.</p><p>Â </p><p>Sony says that the Xperia 5 IV, the Xperia 1 IV, the Xperia 5 III, the Xperia 1 III, the Xperia 5 II, or the Xperia 1 II, if they run Android, are the only smartphones that can run Mocopi.</p><p>Â </p><p>The library for iOS is much bigger than the one for Android.</p><p>Â </p><p>Most AR and VR headsets on the market today let users control their senses, such as their vision and hearing, which makes them feel more totally involved in the experience.</p><p>Â </p><p>But Mocopi doesn't do well in any of these areas.</p><p>Â </p><p>If Mocopi were to be made available to everyone, the word "metaverse" might be used all the time.</p><p>Â </p>";s:10:"post_title";s:63:"How will Sony's motion-tracking system transform the metaverse?";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:61:"how-will-sonys-motion-tracking-system-transform-the-metaverse";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2023-01-04 18:15:11";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2023-01-04 12:45:11";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";i:0;s:4:"guid";s:28:"https://sdlccorp.com/?p=6846";s:10:"menu_order";i:0;s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";s:6:"filter";s:3:"raw";}}
