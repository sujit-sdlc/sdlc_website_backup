Provided by SDLC CORP</a></h2>		
			<h3>Private Blockchain Networks</h3>		
		Secure and scalable permission-based ecosystems with less downtime.		
			<h3>Decentralized Apps (dApps)</h3>		
		Encoded peer-to-peer apps with zero frustration and interruption.		
			<h3>Smart Contracts
</h3>		
		Protocols that guarantee the integrity of multi-party agreements and automatically enforce fixed obligations.		
			<h3>Crypto Wallets</h3>		
		Digital wallets for storing and manipulating cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Etherium, Ripple, etc.).		
			<h3>Asset Tokenization Platforms
</h3>		
		Decentralized platforms that allow users to create, manage and trade their tokens (including NFT platforms.)		
			<h3>Blockchain-Based Market Platforms</h3>		
		Peer-to-peer platforms (e.g., lending platforms, blockchain-based marketplaces, etc.) for transparent, fraud-free transactions between the involved parties.		
			<h3>Decentralised Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)</h3>		
		Blockchain-based platforms for collaborative decision-making that drive high productivity, transparency and trust across communities with no central authority.		
			<h3>Hyperledger Based Solutions</h3>		
		Using Hyper Ledger, we develop blockchain applications that are scalable, immutable, trusted, protected and support a range of plugins.		
			<h3>Permissioned Blockchain</h3>		
		We expand enterprise-grade distributed ledger as well as codebase, which keeps under control the involvement in the open-source distributed ledger.		
			<h3>Crypto Token Development</h3>		
		Our team of blockchain developers offers the service of digital tokenization. The tokens we create can be used to represent asset value to be traded as cryptocurrency, and loyalty points, instead of cash.		
			<h3>Custom Blockchain Solutions</h3>		
		We provide customized blockchain solutions to join with your existing mobile apps and therefore, make them Dapps.		
			<h3>Crypto Exchange Development</h3>		
		We help you to grow a hack-proof platform for the real-time exchange of cryptocurrencies on iOS as well as Android.		
			<h3>Blockchain Development Service for Applications<br></h3>		
		Being an early adopter of Blockchain technology, we've gained huge expertise in building high-quality, scalable distributed applications and customized protocols. We concentrate on Proof of Concept (POC) development and we have successfully developed multiple POCs thus far across various industries.
